# Whats_In_A_Bottle
Group project to determine how which wines are good based on consumer reports and contents of the wine


4-10-21
* Created a Jupyter Notebook file that loads individual wine type csv files into DataFrames and adds an additional column for wine variety (red, white, sparkling, rose). The dataframes were concatenated to create one DataFrame with all wine information. The concatenated Dataframe was exported to a csv file [("compiled_wine.csv")](https://github.com/arahogc/Whats_In_A_Bottle/blob/Jess/Resources/compiled_wine.csv).
