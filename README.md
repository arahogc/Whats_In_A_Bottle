Group project to determine how which wines are good based on consumer reports and contents of the wine

* I am currently using pdAdmin to create tables for the CSVs to create the Database. I am having problems importing the data into the tables.
* I have downloaded the text file which contains the SQL script that created the tables for the datasets. This will need some updating to get the data to load.
* A png of the ERD from QuickDBD has been downloaded. 
* I have a dataset that is too large to upload directly. I will have to find out how to load a large dataset to a branch (or main) if we need to include it.

I am researching how to convert regions into latitudes and longitudes so that we can map the wine regions.

* https://towardsdatascience.com/geocode-with-python-161ec1e62b89 - I got this code to work on a single location, but I'm not sure if I will eventually get an output for the 1236 unique locations that I was able to create. I need to create a new csv file with the locations from the dataframe.
* I am planning to create a new table on pgAdmin with the cleaned data from Jess's work.
