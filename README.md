I am currently using pdAdmin to create tables for the CSVs to create the Database. I am having problems importing the data into the tables.
I have downloaded the text file which contains the SQL script that created the tables for the datasets. This will need some updating to get the data to load.
A png of the ERD from QuickDBD has been downloaded.
