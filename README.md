* I am currently using pdAdmin to create tables for the CSVs to create the Database. I am having problems importing the data into the tables.
* I have downloaded the text file which contains the SQL script that created the tables for the datasets. This will need some updating to get the data to load.
* A png of the ERD from QuickDBD has been downloaded. 
* I have a dataset that is too large to upload directly. I will have to find out how to load a large dataset to a branch (or main) if we need to include it.

I am researching how to convert regions into latitudes and longitudes so that we can map the wine regions.
